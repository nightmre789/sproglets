Although children with autism have been the focus of many research efforts, the condition remains very difficult to understand. However, many experts consider autism to be organic in nature (Sturmey & Sevin, 1994) and due to generic factors (Rutter, 1996). Recent reports of prevalence rates estimate a frequency of 1 per 1000 (Bryson, 1996) and affecting more days than girls (4:1) (Bailey, Philips, & Rutter, 1996).",
      "more": "According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) autism is indicated by pervasive impairment in several areas of development: reciprocal social interaction skills, communication skills, and the presence of stereotyped behavior, interests, and activities. The qualitative impairments that define these conditions are distinctly deviant relative to the individual’s developmental level or mental age."
